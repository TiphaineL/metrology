Here are some calculations for the fine metrology system.
The goal is to be able to measure the opd between two (satellite) telescopes (d1 minus d2) by measuring
several opd (dA-dB, dA-dC, dA-dD, dB-dC, dB-dD, dC-dD) between the chief satellite and the telescopes.

Two taylor expansions have been performed to get an expression of the opd (d1 minus d2) as a function of the
measured opds (dA-dB, dA-dC, dA-dD, dB-dC, dB-dD, dC-dD).

d1_TaylorExpansion checks the accuracy of the expansions for measuring the distance between the chief satellite
and one of the telescopes.

d1_minus_d2 checks the accuracy of the opd (d1 minus d2)
